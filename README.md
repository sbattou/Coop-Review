# Coop-Review
The project aims to develop a website catered to co-op students looking to find co-op placements in software engineering. It will allow users to post reviews and other information regarding specific positions, or in general, at any given company (think Glassdoor). As with Glassdoor, users can review different aspects of each position, from interview experience, to on-the- job experience, to salary. Users can also upvote specific reviews they found useful.
# Installation
